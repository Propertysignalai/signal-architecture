Signal V2 — Complete Product Workflow
Map to Mailbox: The Full User Journey

OVERVIEW
Signal V2 decouples research from scoring. Research happens first on the map — building
market intelligence that gets stored and visualized. Scoring happens later when a property
list is pulled. This means intelligence is always fresh, always available, and never wasted.
MAP → RESEARCH → VISUALIZE → SELECT → PULL DATA → SCORE → BUILD → MAIL

PHASE 1: ZIP SELECTION ON MAP
What happens: User opens the Signal coverage map and selects target ZIP codes.
How it works:
Interactive map with click-to-select ZIPs
ZIPs highlight as selected (green fill)
Sidebar shows selected ZIP list with count
Copy/paste functionality for ZIP lists
Can select individual ZIPs or draw a region
No commitment yet — this is exploration mode
User decides: “These are the areas I want to investigate.”
Output: Selected ZIP list (e.g., 63136, 63137, 63138, 63033, 63034)

PHASE 2: RESEARCH (Layer 0 → Layer 1 → Layer 2)

What happens: For each selected ZIP, the full V2 research pipeline runs.
Per ZIP:
1. Layer 0: Strategy Education — Claude produces a strategy education document based
on the user’s exit strategy (Fix & Flip, Wholesale, BRRRR, etc.)
2. Layer 1: 10 Research Agents — Perplexity agents investigate the ZIP across 10
domains in parallel:
Physical Environment & Housing Stock
Financial Positions & Transaction Patterns
Distress & Legal Activity
Ownership Structure & Occupancy
Market Dynamics & Demographic Forces
Temporal & Seasonal Patterns
Economic Stress & Leading Indicators
Investor & Competitive Landscape
Regulatory & Political Environment
Neighborhood & Micro-Location Intelligence
3. Layer 2: Intelligence Enrichment — Claude reads across all 10 agents and adds crossdomain tags, conflict identification, mosaic patterns, proxy validations, propensity to
sell, and data quality assessment
Output per ZIP: Complete intelligence package — strategy education + raw agent findings
+ Layer 2 enrichments
All research data is SAVED for scoring later.

PHASE 3: MAP UPDATE WITH RESEARCH
What happens: The map updates to reflect what the research actually found. This is where
the user SEES the intelligence visually.
Map shows per ZIP:
Signal strength tier (Strong Signal / Moderate Signal / Weak Signal)

Key findings summary on hover/click
Propensity to sell indicators
Mosaic confidence level (how many domains converged)
Distress indicators
Market trajectory (growing, stable, declining)
Agent convergence patterns
Color coding based on strategy fit
What the user learns:
“63136 is a distress-heavy market with high propensity — strong signal for Fix & Flip”
“63034 looks stable on the surface but has low seller motivation — weak signal”
“63137 has interesting patterns but thin data — moderate signal, lower confidence”
The map becomes the decision tool. Not a spreadsheet. Not a report. A visual intelligence
layer the user can explore, compare, and learn from.
Research data stays saved — it doesn’t expire. If the user comes back in a week, the
intelligence is still there.

PHASE 4: FINAL ZIP SELECTIONS FOR MAILING LIST
What happens: Based on the research-powered map, the user makes their FINAL
selections — which ZIPs will actually become a mailing campaign.
User narrows down:
Started with 15 ZIPs of interest
Research ran on all 15
Map showed 8 as strong signal, 4 moderate, 3 weak
User selects the 8 strong + 2 moderate = 10 ZIPs for mailing
This is a different selection than Phase 1. Phase 1 was “investigate these.” Phase 4 is
“mail these.” Research informed the decision.
Output: Final ZIP list for mailing campaign

PHASE 5: PULL RAW PROPERTY DATA
What happens: Raw property list data is pulled for the final selected ZIPs. This could
happen same day as research or weeks later.
Data sources: PropStream, BatchLeads, ListSource, SMARTData, or any other provider
Flow:
1. User pulls property records for final ZIPs from their data provider
2. Raw CSV uploaded to Signal
3. List Conversion pipeline normalizes to Signal’s 92-column format (handles any source)
4. Clean, standardized property list ready for scoring
Key insight: The property data is FRESH — pulled when the user is ready to mail, not when
research was conducted. Research tells you WHERE to pull. The pull itself gets current
records.
Output: Standardized property list (50,000+ rows) for the selected ZIPs

PHASE 6: APPLY SCORING USING SAVED RESEARCH
What happens: The saved research intelligence from Phase 2 is now applied to the actual
property list. This is where Layer 3 and Layer 4 come in.
Layer 3: Scoring Translation (Claude)
Sees the saved intelligence package for the first time alongside column definitions
Maps research findings to scoring column relevance
Generates 6 JavaScript scoring functions:
calculateCO(row) → Base Signal Points
calculateCP(row) → Final Signal Score (100-1500)
calculateCQ(row) → Noise Filter (0-100)
calculateCR(row) → Temporal Urgency (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
calculateCS(row) → Dynamic Offer Amount ($)
calculateCT(row) → Offer Percentage (0-100%)

Produces combination functions (multi-factor multipliers)
Applies geographic tier multipliers per ZIP
Weights confidence based on Layer 2’s data quality assessment
Layer 4: Execution (Vercel)
Takes JS functions from Layer 3 + property list CSV
Executes scoring functions against every row
Calculates all 6 scores per property
Sorts by Signal Score descending
Stores scored results to Base44
Output: Fully scored property list — every property has a Signal Score, Noise Filter,
Temporal Urgency, Dynamic Offer Amount, and Offer Percentage

PHASE 7: CAMPAIGN BUILDER
What happens: User builds their mailing campaign from the scored list using filters and
thresholds.
Available filters:
Signal Score minimum (e.g., only properties scoring 800+)
Noise Filter threshold (e.g., only high-confidence scores above 60)
Temporal Urgency (e.g., only HIGH urgency for time-sensitive campaigns)
Offer range (e.g., only properties where dynamic offer is $50K-$150K)
Strategy-specific filters (distress type, ownership pattern, etc.)
Geographic filters (specific ZIPs within the selection)
Property characteristics (beds, baths, sqft, year built, etc.)
User controls:
Total mail count target (e.g., “I want to mail 5,000 properties”)
Budget constraints (offer amount ranges)
Campaign type (first touch, follow-up, high-priority)

Exclusions (already contacted, under contract, do not mail)
Output: Filtered campaign list with property count, total estimated offers, campaign stats

PHASE 8: FINAL MAILING LIST — FILTERED & READY TO GO
What happens: The campaign list is finalized, exported, and ready for mail house or direct
mail platform.
Final output includes per property:
Full property details (address, owner, beds/baths/sqft, etc.)
Signal Score
Noise Filter confidence
Temporal Urgency flag
Dynamic Offer Amount
Offer Percentage
Key distress indicators that triggered the score
Export formats:
CSV for mail house upload
Direct integration with mailing platforms
Base44 deal pipeline sync
The cycle completes: ZIP on a map → researched → scored → filtered → in the mailbox.

KEY INSIGHT: RESEARCH AND SCORING ARE DECOUPLED
This is the architectural breakthrough of V2. In V1, research and scoring happened in the
same pipeline run — research a market, immediately generate scoring functions,
immediately score. If you wanted to score again later, you had to re-research.
In V2:
Research is an investment. Run it once, store it, visualize it on the map, reference it
anytime.
Scoring is an application. Apply stored research to any property list, anytime, as many
times as needed.
The map is the interface. Research isn’t a background process — it’s a visible,
explorable intelligence layer.
Time doesn’t matter. Research on Monday, pull data on Thursday, score on Friday. The
intelligence persists.
This decoupling means:
1. Users can research speculatively (investigate 50 ZIPs, only mail 10)
2. Research costs are front-loaded but reusable
3. Scoring can be re-run with fresh property data without re-researching
4. The map accumulates intelligence over time — it gets smarter with every run

THE PHILOSOPHY
Signal V2 is map-first, research-driven, score-when-ready.
The map isn’t a visualization of scores. The map IS the product. It’s where the user thinks,
explores, compares, and decides. Scores are what happens after the decision is made.
All Signal. No Noise.
