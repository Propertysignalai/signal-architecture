Signal Architecture Dashboard — Update Brief for Sig
February 18, 2026

Versioning (Keep It Simple)
Origin — 1 agent, 1 pass, Signal was born. The generalist. V1 — In production today. Geoproximity framework, grouped ZIPs, multiple agents per group. Investors use this. V2 —
What we’re building now. 10 domain specialists per ZIP, Layer 0 strategy education, Layer 2
intelligence enrichment, bias protection chain.
No other version numbers. No v3, v4, iteration labels anywhere on the site.

Page-by-Page Updates
1. Homepage (Map to Mailbox)
Phase 2 description — update:
Per ZIP: Layer 0 strategy education → 10 parallel research agents → Layer 2 intelligence
enrichment. Outputs include propensity to sell, mosaic patterns, conflict flags, and data
quality assessment. All data SAVED.
Phase 6 description — update:
Layer 3 (Claude): First layer to see both research AND scoring columns. Maps
intelligence to JS scoring functions. Layer 4 (Vercel): Executes against every row.
“Key Insight” section — Consider making “Research and scoring are decoupled” a firstclass visual element, not a footnote. It’s the single most important concept in the product.

2. Evolution Page
Bottom tagline — change:
OLD: “The filtering principle at every layer of the architecture.”

NEW: Remove this line entirely. Just keep “All Signal. No Noise.” The word “filtering”
contradicts the enrichment architecture.
V2 domain list — fix: The 10th domain is listed as “narrative synthesis.” It should be “microlocation intelligence.” The actual 10 domains:
1. Physical Environment & Housing Stock
2. Financial Positions & Transaction Patterns
3. Distress & Legal Activity
4. Ownership Structure & Occupancy
5. Market Dynamics & Demographic Forces
6. Temporal & Seasonal Patterns
7. Economic Stress & Leading Indicators
8. Investor & Competitive Landscape
9. Regulatory & Political Environment
10. Neighborhood & Micro-Location Intelligence
V2 agent count clarification:
Current: “500 Agents”
Suggestion: Keep 500 but add context: “10 specialists × 50 ZIPs” so it doesn’t read like
500 distinct agents
V2 depth stat:
Current: “~30pg Per ZIP”
Update to: “10–30pg Per ZIP” (varies by market data availability)
Model attributions:
V2 uses Claude for Layer 0 and Layer 2, but Perplexity for the 10 research agents
Consider noting this or just saying “Powered by Claude + Perplexity” for V2
V1 agent count:
Current: “~8 Agents”
More accurate: “3–10 Agents” (varied by geo group size)

3. Agents Page
Add a line above or below the agent grid explaining the philosophy:
“Each agent receives strategy education and determines independently what matters
within their domain. No prescribed fields. No form-filling. The agent decides what to
research, how deep to go, and what’s positive or negative for the investor’s strategy.”
Agent descriptions — current descriptions list expected data types like a schema (e.g.,
“Age, condition, vacancy”). These are fine as shorthand but slightly misleading since agents
find what exists in each market, which may differ from what’s listed. Optional: add a small
note like “Representative focus areas — actual findings vary by market.”

4. Bias Protection Page — Best Page, One Fix
Layer 2 card needs updating:
Title change:
OLD: “Intelligence Analyst” / “Strategy-blind synthesis & dedup”
NEW: “Intelligence Enrichment” / “Strategy-blind enrichment & pattern recognition”
KNOWS section — replace:
OLD: “Dedup logic”
NEW: List should include: enrichment tagging, cross-agent confirmation, conflict
detection, mosaic pattern recognition, proxy validation, propensity to sell assessment,
data quality scoring
The key concept: Layer 2 doesn’t condense or filter agent findings. Raw findings pass
through the pipeline intact. Layer 2 ADDS intelligence on top — tags, patterns, validations,
propensity. Information is gained, never lost.
Everything else on this page is accurate. The KNOWS / UNKNOWN / BLOCKED matrix is
excellent.

5. Data Flow (Pipeline) Page
L2 node output description — update:
OLD: “deduped intel, conflicts, mosaic, propensity”
NEW: “enrichment tags, conflicts, mosaic patterns, proxy validations, propensity, data

quality”
Parse & Format Output node — update description:
OLD: “IN: L2 analysis JSON / OUT: final intelligence package”
NEW: “IN: raw agent findings (from Merge) + L2 enrichments / OUT: combined
intelligence package”
This matters because the Parse node is the assembly point — it combines the raw agent
findings that passed through the code pipeline with Layer 2’s enrichment additions.

6. Status Page
Move to “Built” (these are done):
V2 workflow deploy & test
Full pipeline testing

(all 10 agents validated, QA report generated)

Add to “Planned”:
No-strategy mode (propensity-only for multi-strategy clients)
Contrasting market test (healthy/growing market validation)
Rerun consistency testing
Agent prompt tuning (Agents 5, 8, 10)
Multi-ZIP batch orchestration

Global Find-and-Replace
Across all pages, watch for and update these terms:
OLD

NEW

filtering / dedup / synthesis (when describing

enrichment / pattern recognition /

Layer 2)

validation

v3, v4, iteration numbers within V2

Remove — just “V2 architecture”

“Strategy-blind synthesis”

“Strategy-blind enrichment”

“deduped intel”

“enrichment tags”

Summary
The dashboard structure is strong. These are content updates, not redesigns. The biggest
theme is replacing “filtering/dedup/synthesis” language with “enrichment” language
throughout — Layer 2 adds intelligence on top of agent findings, it never removes or
condenses them. And keep versioning clean: Origin → V1 (production) → V2 (building now).
